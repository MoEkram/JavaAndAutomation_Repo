package k_Polymorphism;// Polymorphism = handling objects differently based on their data type

// Polymorphism can be:
//              Overloading ( Static ) : more than one method with same name, behave differently based on the arguments passed while calling them.
//                                       ex: you have method/object say getURL(), getURL(int x), getURL(int x, int y)
//                                       each one has different implementation
//                                       Which method will be called ? this will be decided at the (time of compilation).
//              Overriding ( Dynamic ) : child-class is implementing a super-class method in different way
//                                       this will happen ( at runtime ) .. its called ( Runtimess Polymorphism )
